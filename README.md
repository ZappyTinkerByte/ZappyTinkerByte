- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZappyTinkerByte
- ðŸ‘€ I like electronics, coding, 3D design and printing and everything in between. I treat this as my hobby, and consider myself an amateur. I do not have formal training, education, or job experience in this field, but I do enjoy collaborating with other developers!
- Iâ€™m interested in home automation work space, and enjoy tinkering with my own projects to make my life easier (ahem ahem complicated for no reason). I place a huge emphasis on practical and future proof design that might help with that covered Partner Approval Factor (PAF).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Home Assistant based home automation system, and looking to collaborate on for same. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I will edit this later.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Ugh, I am very bad at this! I am not fun. Let me be a nerd.
